Hi I am Michael, you know... icueMike? Yep, thats me! This is my very first blog post. THE VERY FIRST.

I will be writing all kinds of technical, logical, rants and... yea, more tech stuff. Just bare in mind that, if it's just a rant, its just my humble opinion ok? Primarily to increase my own understanding of concepts(Looking at you, Scope and Hoisting), for stuff I found on the internet about web dev stuff.

I'll also post some snippets for you to share and some of my creations or contributions and what-nots.

My writing, grammar and or typing is quite rusty since I try to never look at the keyboard, but no issues. I'll be improving it day by day by posting here something.

Wait Wait Wait. Let me check if my code highlighting is working.

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
}
const element = <Welcome name="Faisal Arkan" />
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'))
```

Holla!!!
